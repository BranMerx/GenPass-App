# GenPass-App
A random password generator that follows the same principals as my standalone GenerPass project, however this one has the main intention on becoming a downloadble mobile app for both Android and IOS. 
The main purpose of this project is to learn how to develop mobile apps and I will be achieving this through the use of Python, Kivy, and other related resources. 

One of the biggest challenges I had for this project was learning how exactly to develop Apps and how they differ between a regular web page or other sort of development-related project.
